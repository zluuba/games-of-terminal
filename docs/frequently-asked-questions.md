# F.A.Q.

**Q: Why are the items in the menu so crooked?**  
A: This issue is console-specific. If you have both even-length and odd-length words, they cannot be centered in that environment.

**Q: Why does this little console app use so much CPU sometimes?**  
A: Because it's written in Python. Feel free to rewrite it in Rust.

**Q: Why was GOT written in Python?**  
A: I'm sorry, okay? This is my first big pet project, which was written in the first programming language that I learned.

**Q: Can you rewrite GOT in Rust?**  
A: Maybe.

**Q: Why don't the keys work correctly? Sometimes, when I press 'w' in the menu or game, nothing happens, but the arrows work.**  
A: You should keep your keyboard with an English layout while using GOT. I described this problem [here](link-to-twitter-post).

**Q: Why doesn't GOT have any sounds?**  
A: GOT is evolving every day. It doesn't have sounds YET, like many other features.

**Q: Why are there only 4 games?**  
A: I need a job, so I don't have time to implement as many games as I want. Here's the [list of upcoming feature games](https://github.com/zluuba/games-of-terminal/tree/main/docs/upcoming-features.md).
