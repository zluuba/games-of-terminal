# F.A.Q.

**Q: Why are the items in the menu so crooked?**  
A: This issue is console-specific. If you have both even-length and odd-length words, they cannot be centered in that environment.

**Q: Why don't the keys work correctly? Sometimes, when I press 'w' in the menu or game, nothing happens, but the arrows work.**  
A: You should keep your keyboard with an English layout while using GOT. Keyboards are different, languages are different, 
there's no good and clear way to solve this problem. But in the future, I'm planning to implement the ability to 
add your own game control keys, which should solve this problem.

**Q: Why are there only 4 games?**  
A: There will be more in the future, here's the [list of upcoming feature games](https://github.com/zluuba/games-of-terminal/tree/main/docs/upcoming-features.md). 

**Q: Why does this little console app use so much CPU sometimes?**  
A: Because it's written in Python, feel free to rewrite it in Rust. Or maybe I'm just not good enough at optimization yet. 
I think the answer is somewhere in between.

**Q: Why was GOT written in Python?**  
A: This is my first big pet project, which was written in the first programming language that I learned.

**Q: Can you rewrite GOT in Rust?**  
A: Maybe.

**Q: Why did you write GOT?**  
A: I've loved the idea of GOT since I created it. And now it feels too good to let it go.
