All logic is built in the App class.


1. User typing: 'term-games'
    -> cli starting app from 'scripts/app.py'
    -> app makes App obj
        -> App.__init__ make some setups
        -> App.__init__ run start_app() func

2. Now app is running
    -> start_app func makes Menu obj
        -> show_menu() func shows logo and menu (add tips?)
        -> user selects game with arrows and press enter
        -> Menu obj creates Game obj and return it
            -> start() func starts the game

3. Now the game has begun
    -> game draw game boxes, and set up to pause, waiting for user keypress
        -> if user press enter - game starts
        -> q - game quit
        -> m - go to the menu
        -> ..other specific game keys..

4. Now user is playing
    -> if user press to m, start() func returns True, and we start over from 2.1.1
    -> if user press to q, start() func returns False, and we starting is_game_over() func

5. We in is_game_over() func
    -> we ask: 'are you sure'
        -> if 'yes' or enter, returns True and go to the over_the_game() func
            -> it's shown goodbye message and quit the app
        -> if 'no' or esc, returns False, and start over the game (or menu) from 3.0.0
